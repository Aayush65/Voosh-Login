# Deployment

Make a new folder of `name` (any name) and open your terminal after going into the folder.

Then run the following commands before the first deployment to upgrade the dependencies:

```bash
  npm install -g npm-check-updates
  npm-check-updates -u
  npm install 
```

This would install all the necessary dependencies of the project.

You can also change the name of the project by going into the package.json and changing the "name" value.

Now deploy the frontend with the `npm run dev` command.
